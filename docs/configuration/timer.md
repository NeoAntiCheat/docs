# Timer Checks

Below are the configuration entries for all sub-checks within the `Timer` module.

## Type A

### `average-max`
Evaluate whether the average packet sending rate of the players is higher than the specified value. Increasing it to 1.01 would impose a more stringent check, but a recommended value is 1.05.

### `streak`
Flagging will occur only when the threshold is consecutively exceeded.

## Type C [Work in Progress]
**Note: This check is currently unstable and remains a work in progress.**
