# Reach Checks
Below are the configuration entries for all sub-checks in the `Reach` module.

## Type A

### `cancel-hit`
Specifies whether to cancel this interaction when the player's reach exceeds the limit.

### `max-reach`
Defines the maximum allowable reach distance. You can adjust it to 3.1 or 3.05 to make the check more stringent.

### `steps`
Smaller values indicate more accurate detection but may also result in increased performance overhead.
