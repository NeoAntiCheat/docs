## Supported Versions

### Client
**1.18.X ~ Latest**
::: warning
Ensure that the player's client version supports **PlayerAuthInput** (>= 1.18.X).
:::
For the Bedrock edition, supporting lower versions is impractical, and logging in via Microsoft's Xbox is not possible with lower versions.

### Server
We compile the plugin using JDK8, ensuring compatibility with all NukkitX forks! However, we highly recommend using the **[Nukkit-MOT](https://github.com/MemoriesOfTime/Nukkit-MOT)** branch for optimal support. Other branches may not guarantee full compatibility with all features of the plugin.

We vehemently discourage the use of **[Nukkit-PM1E](https://github.com/PetteriM1/NukkitPetteriM1Edition)** as it violates the **GPLv3** open-source agreement and employs paid obfuscators for protection, compromising the community's ecological balance. **We strongly condemn any project that undermines the principles of open source!**
