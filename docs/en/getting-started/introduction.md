## Supported Versions

### Client
**1.18.X to Latest** versions
::: warning Notice
Ensure that player clients support **PlayerAuthInput** (>= 1.18.X).
:::
For Bedrock Edition, supporting lower versions is impractical, and lower versions cannot authenticate through Microsoft Xbox login.

### Server
We compile the plugin using JDK8 to ensure compatibility with all NukkitX forks! However, we recommend using the **[Nukkit-MOT](https://github.com/MemoriesOfTime/Nukkit-MOT)** fork for optimal support. Other forks may not guarantee full compatibility with all plugin features.
